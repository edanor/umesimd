RELEASE NOTES for v0.3.1-stable

Interface:
- added PROMOTE/DEGRADE operations to convert between vectors using scalars of different precision (e.g. PROMOTE SIMD4_32f to SIMD4_64f)
- added LOG, LOG2, LOG10 to floating point interface
- added CMPEQS/CMPNES for masks
- added compilation flag to switch between '[]' and '()' syntax for writemasks
- added overloaded operators for mixed scalar<->vector operations (Issue #25)
- added missing operator= (ISSUE #26)
- added writemask operators for scalars (e.g. vec[mask] = scalar)

Performance tuning:
- AVX512 (SKX + KNL): SIMDMask4/8/32, SIMD4_32u/i/f, SIMD8_32u/i/f, SIMD32_32u/i/f, (extensive update)

Bug fixes:
- AVX2: SIMD4_32f missing 'const' qualifier in STORE
- AVX: add missing definitions for float vectors
- AVX512: separation between different AVX512 ISA variations
- AVX512: AVX512: missing explicit in constructor of SIMDMask<8>


Examples:
- added basic example for SIMD vector showing MFI(Member Function Interface) and operator syntax.

Tests:
- added generic unit tests for SIMD using 64f, 8u/i and 16u/i scalar types.

Benchmarks:
- added Latencies benchmark allowing monitoring of library performance with instruction-level granularity
- added Mandelbrot Set benchmark

Internal code:
- fixed missing template<> for templated cast operators
- extended NullTypes and eliminate SIMD1 template specializations; this change simplifies the plugin system and fixes loose ends of the typeset system;
- remove 'final' class specifiers to allow custom extensions of SIMD types; this change allows using SIMD types as base classes for custom vectorization interfaces;
