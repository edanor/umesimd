// ***************************************************************************

   After downloading this repository you can try compiling and executing unit
   test code and some microbenchmarks provided with the library. The code
   doesn't contain any 'make' like file system.

   1) Windows:
        
        On windows it is possible to create VS solution. Simply execute

        > cd unittest
        > create_solution_vs2012.bat

        Solution should be created in 'unittest/vs2012project'. Opening the
        solution and building it can be performed as with regular solution.

     To debug unit test solution 
      a) RMB on UMSSIMDUnitTest project
      b) select "Set as startup project"
      c) press F5 or select "Debug->Start Debugging"

     To build for different instruction set:
      a) RMB on UMESIMDUnitTest project
      b) select "properties"
      c) "Configuration Properties->C/C++->Code Generation"
      d) Change "Enable Enhanced Instruction Set" field

      To build for performance measurements, make sure that
      both optimizations and inlining are turned ON:
      a) "Properties->Configuration Properties->Optimization->Optimization"
          
          is set to: "Maximize Speed (/O2)"
          
      b) "Properties->Configuration Properties->Optimization->
           ->Inline Function Expansion"
      
          is set to: "Any Suitable (/Ob2)"
      
   2) Linux:
     $ cd unittest
     $ g++ UMESIMDUnitTest.cpp -std=c++11 -O2

   // NOTE the same build can be performed using ICC, but an additional flag:
   //
   //    -fp-model precise
   //
   //  needs to be added to make sure the same floating point model is used 
   //  as for g++.

   To build for different instruction set use following flags:

   GCC:
    - FMA:  -mfma
    - AVX:  -mavx
    - AVX2: -mavx2
    - AVX512: -mavx512f -mavx512pf -mavx512er -mavx512cd

   ICC:
    - FMA:    -fma
    - AVX:    -xavx
    - AVX2:   -xCORE-AVX2
    - AVX512: -xCORE-AVX512

   If you are able to compile unit tests and spot no fails, you can try
   compiling some of our microbenchmarks:

    $ cd microbenchmars
    $ g++ average.cpp -std=c++11 -O2 
    $ g++ polynomial.cpp -std=c++11 -O2

   If you want to use library in your own code, simply include:

    UMESimd.h
 
   file into your project. Data types can be then used by adding:

    using namespace UME::SIMD
 
   or by prefixing name of data types with 'UME::SIMD::' .



// ***************************************************************************
// II. BASIC USAGE 
// ***************************************************************************

   The C++ implementation gives the user a strict programming interface.
   Because the interface in itself was designed so that it could be
   implemented using languages other than c++, the operations permitted on
   data types are using opcodes instead of c++ function prototypes. In 
   general each member function can be called upon the same SIMD vector type.
   For example:

     SIMD4_32u vec_u_1(4), vec_u_2(2); // Declaring 2 vectors, each of 4 
                                       // unsigned integer elements each of
                                       // 32 bit precision.
     SIMD8_64f vec_d_1(3.14),          // Declaring 2 vectors, each of 8
               vec_d_2(2.71);          // floating point elements each of
                                       // 64 bit precision.
                                     
     vec_u_1.adda(vec_u_2);            // Add values from vec_u_1 and vec_u_2,
                                       // and store the result in vec_u_1.
                                      
     vec_d_1.adda(vec_d_2);            // Add values from vec_d_1 and vec_d_2,
                                       // and store the result in vec_d_1.
                                      
   The interface makes a division between operations that are available only
   on unsigned integer, signed integer of floating point vector types. This 
   limitiation comes from the definition of scalar type. For example following
   operation:

     vec_u_1.ceil();         
    
   doesn't make too much sense, since ceiling operation is defined only for
   floating point operations. Trying to call this operation on integer type
   would result in an identity operation. 

   On the other hand, the floating point vector types support all operations
   that are well defined for both signed and unsigned integer types. Addition
   operation is one of them, hence the above example makes complete sense.



// ***************************************************************************
// III. C++ OPERATOR OVERLOADING
// ***************************************************************************

   There is almost no operator overloading in UME::SIMD!!! 
   
   One exception is EXTRACT operation that is commonly used to implement 
   scalar emulation. EXTRACT operation uses 'operator[]' to access indexed
   elements. Because this operation is very slow it is not advised to use 
   it in user code, except for certain cases when there is no other
   possibility.

   Second exception is ASSIGN operation used to assign value of one
   vector to another. ASSIGN is implemented using 'operator=' and is
   limited to vectors of the same type.
   
   There are some rational reasons for not having overloaded operators

1. There is a limited list of operators a user could overload:

     - * / % ˆ & | ~ ! = < > += -= *= /= %= ˆ= &= |= << >> >>= <<= == != <= >=
     && || ++ -- , ->* -> ( ) [ ]
 
   All of above operators have fixed number of operands. Problem arises when a
   user would like to perform masking operation. Mask is another operand so
   using the C++ operators would lead to multiple implementations when
   implementing masked and non-masked code:

     SIMD4_32f a, b, c, d;

     a += b + c *d + c*b + c^2;

   Now what happens when yo would like to add masks to the operation?
   The only way to do so is to implement functions that take mask arguments.

   SIMDMask4 m1, m2, m3,m4, m5, m6, m7;
   
   a = add(m1, a, 
               add(m2, add(m3, add(m4, b, mul(m5, c, d)), 
                       add(m6, mul(m7, c, b), sqr(m8, c)))
                   )
          );
   
   Because UME::SIMD uses member functions instead of regular functions,
   The same code would be implemented as:

     SIMD4_32f a, b, c, d;
     SIMD4_32f t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5;
     SIMDMask4, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7

     t0 = c.mul(m5, d);
     t1 = c.mul(m7, b);
     t2 = c.sqr(m8);
     t3 = b.add(m4, t0);
     t4 = t1.add(m6, t2);
     t5 = t3.add(m3, t4);
     a = a.add(m1, t5);

   or as:

     a = a.add(m1, (b.add(m4, c.mul(m5, d))).add(m3, (c.mul(m7, b)).add(m6, c.sqr(m8))));

   both forms are correct in terms of syntax provided by the UME::SIMD,
   and should compile to the same instruction list with compiler optimizations
   turned on (Optimization Level 2 advised).

2. With 38 operators to overload with over 60 data types is another 2000+
   functions to write. But since the number of functions available on the 
   interface is already over 200 per data type, this is only a fraction of
   work to be done. And it is still not enough to cover other operations that
   the interface exposes.

3. Implementing operator overloading is very tricky, especially when using 
   templates, because it might affect the template resolution and collide with
   templates present in other libraries. Because of limited resources and
   ability to replace the operators with more uniform member function
   notation, this 'feature' must be postponed in time, probably until
   UME::SIMD version 2.0 (if that ever happens...).



// ***************************************************************************
// IV. IN-PLACE VS. NEW DESTINATION
// ***************************************************************************

   Most of the operations are designed to take one implicit operand and one or
   more explicit operands. For example:

     vec_d_4 = vec_d_1.fmuladd(vec_d_2, vec_d_3);
    
   The operation used is FMULADD (fused multiply and add ) operation which is
   very similar to scalar version:
    
     d_4 = d_1 * d_2 + d_3;

   The operation is often represented as: D = A*B + C.

   If you want to store the result in d_1, you can rewrite this as:

     d_1 = d_1 * d_2 + d_3;

    
   In vectorized version:
     1) vec_d_1 is first  'implicit' source operand, that is 'A'.
     2) vec_d_2 is second 'explicit' source operand, that is 'B'
     3) vec_d_3 is third  'explicit' source operand, that is 'C'
     4) vec_d_4 is destination operand 'D'

   C++ offers 'assignment' operators such as: '+=', '*=', '\=' etc. that take
   the left hand size operand as both source operand and destination operand:

     d_1 *= d_2   ;  // equivalent to d_1 = d_1 * d_2
    
   Because the 'in-place' operation can potentially limit the resource usage
   (number of hardware registers used), and because compilers are not very
   good with handling vector registers, it is advised to use 'assign'
   operations. Most of the interface functions give the same operation in two
   variations:
    
      1) operation with new destination:
      
      vec_1 = vec_2.add(vec_3);  // vec_1 stores result, vec_2 is unchanged
      
      2) operation performed in-place:
      
      vec_2.adda(vec_3);         // vec_2 stores result, no vec_1 declaration
                                 // needed
   
   In general the functions performing 'assign' operation are suffixed with
   'a' such as:
   
   add (A = B + C)       -> adda ( B = B + C)
   fmulsub (A = B*C - D) -> fmulsuba ( B = B*C - D)

   While not all possible combinations are present in the interface, and not
   all functions provide assign operations, the basic set of operations 
   available using standard operators is covered.



// ***************************************************************************
// V. MASK OPERATIONS
// ***************************************************************************

   One advantage of UME::SIMD over other vectorization libraries, is the
   ability to use mask types that are not depending on the vector type used.
   That is, you can just declare SIMDMaskX object like this:

     SIMDMask4 mask4(true, false, false, true); 

   and use it in following code:

     vec_u_1.adda(mask4, vec_u_2); // Use mask1 in masked operation on
                                   // unsigned
                                   // vector. Mind that the function name is
                                   // the same as in the first example.

     vec_d_1.adda(mask4, vec_d_2); // Use mask1 in masked operation on double
                                   // vector. The same mask is used as in the
                                   // first example!
    
   If you have previous experience with SIMD extensions, you will notice that 
   the way masks were represented depended on the scalar type used (AVX,
   AVX2). Newest AVX512 extension introduces concept of 'mask registers'. 
   These registers can be used with vector instructions, so it is possible 
   to hide mask implementation. For instruction sets that don't support masks,
   the internal representation should take care of how the masks are handled.



// ***************************************************************************
// VI. REORDERING OPERATIONS
// ***************************************************************************

   One of the biggest problems to be solved in SIMD programming is the
   implementation of Swizzle operation. Swizzle operation reorders elements of
   a vector. In some implementations, you can find swizzle represented as
   compile time mask of form:

     // Example permutations using swizzle mask representation for SIMD4
     abcd  - identity operations (no reordering)
     abab  - pack upper half and lower half of destination with lower half 
             of source
     aaaa  - broadcast first element to all elements
     cccc  - broadcast third element to all elements
     
   The number of possible swizzle masks is n^n, where n is the length of SIMD.
   That is:

     n = 1 =>  P(1) = 1^1 = 1
     n = 2 =>  P(2) = 2^2 = 4
     n = 4 =>  P(4) = 4^4 = 256
       ...
     n = 128 => P(128) = 128^128 = 5.2829453113566524635233978491652e+269
        
   In other words for SIMD128_8i it is not possible to represent swizzle as 
   predefined constants... 

   The swizzle form used in UME::SIMD is as follows:

     SIMDSwizzle4 sMask(0, 1, 2, 3);  // equivalent of 'abcd' swizzle
     SIMDSwizzle4 sMask(0, 1, 0, 1);  // equivalent of 'abab' swizzle
     SIMDSwizzle4 sMask(0, 0, 0, 0);  // equivalent of 'aaaa' swizzle
     SIMDSwizzle4 sMask(2, 2, 2, 2);  // equivalent of 'cccc' swizzle
     
   This allows the user to create swizzle masks of any sort. The underlying 
   mechanisms perform specialization of swizzle masks for the masks supported
   by the architecture, and perform more time consuming reordering otherwise.

   For performance reasons it is advised for the user to use swizzle masks 
   initialized with constants instead of run-time variables.

   So far swizzle masks can be used only with SWIZZLE operation:
   
     vec_1 = vec_2.swizzle(sMask_1);
    
   Mind that the same operation can also use a mask:
   
     vec_1 = vec_2.swizzle(mask1, sMask_1);
   
   The functions of mask1 and sMask_1 are different!
   From the result perspective, 'sMask_1' will be first used to
   reorder elements of vec_2, then 'mask1' will be used to 
   select elements between the original and reordered vectors.



// ***************************************************************************
// VII. SIMD 1
// ***************************************************************************

  This library implements a set of types that consist of 1 element only. These
  data types are meant as an extension of scalar types into SIMD domain. By 
  doing so it is now possible to use the same interface for both scalar types
  and SIMD types.
  
  As initial performance results show, SIMD1 is in majority of the cases
  equivalent to scalar code execution (with -O2 compilation flag!). Thanks to
  this behaviour it is now possible to write just one piece of code using SIMD
  abstraction and use it to create scalar reference point! This can be very
  useful for measuring the performance drop inflicted by SIMD-like programming
  and to limit the code duplication (separated SIMD1 and larger versions).
  
  One limitation exists on SIMD1 types: they don't implement operations for
  packing and unpacking. Because SIMD1 is the smallest vector length, and the
  vector length is not divisible by 2 there is no data type to be used
  for these operations.



// ***************************************************************************
// VIII. Library reference
// ***************************************************************************

   There is not yet a full library reference. Please refer to
   UMESimdInterface.h for description of all operations. The behaviour of
   any given implementation should be exactly the same as behaviour of
   functions used for scalar emulation. By search the operation opcode it
   is possible to find equivalent member functions.

   This library uses a very simple concept of a SIMD vector being represented 
   by a pair of:
    1) vector length (VEC_LEN) - that is a number of elements packed in a 
       SIMD vector
    2) scalar type (SCALAR_TYPE) - the type of a scalar used to represent 
       a single element in a vector.

   This leads to a following naming convention for all SIMD vectors:
     SIMD<VEC_LEN>_<SCALAR_TYPE>

   SCALAR_TYPE can be one of:
     1) unsigned integer scalar type: uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t
     2) signed integer scalar types: int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t
     3) floating point scalar types: float (32b), double (64b)

   In its current form the library defines all vector types of lengths up to
   1024 bits.

   According to that taxonomy, UMESIMD defines following data types:

    8 bit vectors:
        Unsigned integer      : SIMD1_8u
        Signed integer        : SIMD1_8i

    16 bit vectors:
        Unsigned integer      : SIMD2_8u, SIMD1_16u
        Signed integer        : SIMD2_8i, SIMD1_16i

    32 bit vectors:
        Unsigned integer      : SIMD4_8u, SIMD2_16u, SIMD1_32u
        Signed integer        : SIMD4_8i, SIMD2_16i, SIMD1_32i
        Floating point vectors: SIMD1_32f

    64 bit vectors:
        Unsigned integer      : SIMD8_8u, SIMD4_16u, SIMD2_32u, SIMD1_64u
        Signed integer        : SIMD8_8i, SIMD4_16i, SIMD2_32i, SIMD1_64i
        Floating point vectors: SIMD2_32f, SIMD1_64f

    128 bit vectors:
        Unsigned integer      : SIMD16_8u, SIMD8_16u, SIMD4_32u, SIMD2_64u
        Signed integer        : SIMD16_8i, SIMD8_16i, SIMD4_32i, SIMD2_64i
        Floating point vectors: SIMD4_32f, SIMD2_64f

    256 bit vectors:
        Unsigned integer      : SIMD32_8u, SIMD16_16u, SIMD8_32u, SIMD4_64u
        Signed integer        : SIMD32_8i, SIMD16_16i, SIMD8_32i, SIMD4_64i
        Floating point vectors: SIMD8_32f, SIMD4_64f

    512 bit vectors:
        Unsigned integer      : SIMD64_8u, SIMD32_16u, SIMD16_32u, SIMD8_64u
        Signed integer        : SIMD64_8i, SIMD32_16i, SIMD16_32i, SIMD8_64i
        Floating point vectors: SIMD16_32f, SIMD8_64f

    1024 bit vectors:
        Unsigned integer      : SIMD128_8u, SIMD64_16u, SIMD32_32u, SIMD16_64u
        Signed integer        : SIMD128_8i, SIMD64_16i, SIMD32_32i, SIMD16_64i
        Floating point vectors: SIMD32_32f, SIMD16_64f

   As well as having full spectrum of SIMD vectors, the library also 
   supports 'Mask' types and 'Swizzle Mask' types. Mask types are used widely 
   in the library for conditional execution of operations on SIMD vectors, 
   and for comparison operations. Swizzle Mask types are used in swizzle (that
   is shuffling/reordering/permuting) operations.

   These types are:

   Mask types:
     SIMDMask1, SIMDMask2, SIMDMask4, SIMDMask8, SIMDMask16, SIMDMask32,
     SIMDMask64, SIMDMask128

   Swizzle Mask types:
     SIMDSwizzle1, SIMDSwizzle2, SIMDSwizzle4, SIMDSwizzle8, SIMDSwizzle16,
     SIMDSwizzle32, SIMDSwizzle64, SIMDSwizzle128

   All data types are implemented using C++ classes. All data types
   implement uniform interface accessible as member functions of a 
   particular data type class. Calling a member function uses the object as 
   on of operation operands. In general it is possible to execute the same
   operation on all vector types, with certain restrictions: 
   - SIMD1 types dont implement PACK/UNPACK operations.
   - The swizzle operations on SIMD1 are identity operations.
   - Certain operations are restricted to Signed/floating point data types 
    (e.g square root of a number, sign negation)
   - The masking operations require mask of the same length as SIMD vector.
     An example: SIMDMask4 needs to be used when performing MADD (masked
     addition) operation on SIMD4_32u, SIMD4_32i, SIMD4_32f.

   The library in its current form implements following operations 
   (using interface codenames - function prototypes can be found in
   SIMDInterface.h):

   //NOTE: C++ interface definition will be provided later on. So far
   // majority (about 99%) of the inteface is available with scalar 
   // emulation, although not all combinations are tested.

   1) Operations available on all vector types, mask types and swizzle 
      mask types:
        - LENGTH - returns length of vector (VEC_LEN)
        - ALIGNMENT - returns required alignment for memory operations

   2) Operations available on all SIMD vector types:

    (Initialization)
    - ZERO-CONSTR - Zero element constructor 
    - SET-CONSTR  - One element constructor
    - FULL-CONSTR - constructor with VEC_LEN scalar element 
    - ASSIGNV     - Assignment with another vector
    - MASSIGNV    - Masked assignment with another vector
    - ASSIGNS     - Assignment with scalar
    - MASSIGNS    - Masked assign with scalar
